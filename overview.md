The plan for this game is for the World Map (accessible with ",") is the main world of the game.
From it one level down is the "Land" scene where the player slowly travels (as the travel map).
Below that is the "Combat" scene where the player fights enemies, the combat scene pops up when the player is travelling and encounters an enemy.

Under construction currently and future plans are an area map scene which will be about the same size as the land map. The land map will be broken up into chunks and each chunk will have its own area map. The area map will be a bit more detailed and have more features because the movement here is faster and the player can interact with the environment. Here combat can be Autobattle style or overworld combat with hitboxes, although the TFT style tends to be only among larger groups of enemies and town-scaled combat.

Inside the area map scene there will be a town map scene which is smaller than the area map and is where the player can interact with the environment and build their town.
Inside the town map scene there will be an "Building Interior" scene that will dynamically change based on the town map shape and size of the building. Here the player will be able to interact with individual npcs and build relationships.
