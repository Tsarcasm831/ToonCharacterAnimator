If ever you enounter a problem with files not being able to be updated edited or altered, create a .bak of the file and proceed with the changes you were planning. This is to prevent any loss of data and to be able to revert back to the original file if needed.

Fix Lint errors as soon as they happen instead of waiting for something to break.
